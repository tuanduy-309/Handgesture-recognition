# Handgesture-recognition
Recommend to execute the code in Kaggle environment to avoid bug!
- When running detection.py, we will see a square in the screen, then choose one background and then press B to capture the background.
- Move your hand close to the frame to detect the hand gesture.
- Finally, press Q to quit the detection.
